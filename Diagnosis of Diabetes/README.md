In this project, we first load the diabetes.csv with the help of the sklearn library, and then perform preprocessing on the data so that the model can be trained on train and test data. After that, we normalize the data so that all the numbers are between one and zero. In the next phase, i.e. classification, we use 9 algorithms: k-means ,svm, knn, random forest, decision tree, ann, naive bayes, pca, logistic regression   Finally, we calculate the accuracy of the test and train data, recall and precision of each and compare them with each other so that we can see which algorithm's performance is stronger and with a lower error percentage.
