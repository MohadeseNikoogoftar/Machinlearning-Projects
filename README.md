# Machinlearning-Projects  
In this repository, you can see some examples of machine learning projects written in Python programming language and in the Jupiter notebook server environment.  
In most of them, the virtual machine is set with Python 3.12.5 as the Jupiter kernel. In these projects, using machine learning algorithms such as svm, knn, random forest, decision tree, ann, k-means, pca, logistic regression, etc., we trained the models on train and test data from the dataset. Then we compared their accuracy, recall and precision so that we can finally conclude which algorithm has better performance and lower error percentage.
